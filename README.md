# Movement-RS

A small project I created to get more familiar with Rust. It is not designed to be useful for any specific purpouse, besides learning Rust and having fun.
<br/>The main feature of the program is recording movement of the cursor and trying to find out if the recording is a circle, an ellipse or a straight line.

I'm not very familiar with the mathematical principles normally used to identify shapes from mere coordinate sets. Thus, this is just an attempt of determining which shape has been drawn using my limited knowledge.

If you happen to have a bit of time to spare to improve the program, you're welcome to do so and submit a pull-request and explain what you've done.
